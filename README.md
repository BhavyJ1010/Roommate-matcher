üè† Roommate Matcher
Live Demo: https://2roommate-matcher.streamlit.app/
This is a simple app that helps you find the best roommates for a group of people. It works by asking everyone who they'd like to live with and then finding the fairest matches for everyone.

‚ú® How It Works - 
Imagine you and your friends need to pick roommates. Instead of just guessing, this app helps by:

1. Collecting names: You add the names of all the students.
2. Asking for preferences: Each student ranks their friends from who they want to live with most to least.
3. Making a match: The app uses a smart algorithm to find pairs that everyone is happy with.

üöÄ How to Use It - 
To run this project on your own computer, just follow these simple steps:

1. Get the code: Download or "clone" this project from GitHub.
2. Install the program: Open your computer's terminal and type "pip install -r requirements.txt". This will get all the tools the app needs to run.
3. Start the app: In the terminal, type "streamlit run webapp.py". The app will then open in your web browser.
